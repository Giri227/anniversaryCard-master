  <!-- for readability, I've utilized tabs/indents in my code.  They are NOT required for things to work, but make coding much
		easier to read.  Whenever a tag is opened, the indents increase.  Whenever a tag is closed, I reduce the indents.  That way 
		you can follow an indent straight down and find it's closing tag and easily see all the content that is within.  This is
		one of the best habits you can get into as you learn to code - is indenting and commenting your code.

					The alt parameter is very important, as it should describe your image.  While it is not displayed to the user, it is used
					by screen readers for the visually impaired to explain the content of an image. -->
